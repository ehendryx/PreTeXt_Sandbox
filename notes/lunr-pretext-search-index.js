Using mathematical theory, notation, methods, and tools to answer practical questions is a form of .    One important skill to succeed in this class and beyond is abstraction :     the realization that the letter in an equation might represent the physical size of a cell, the cost of a sweater, the size of a population, the age of a company, etc.    the understanding that although we are interested in a specific application problem, we have to carefully apply the rules of mathematics to achieve a solution---we solve an equation the same way whether or not it is purely a mathematical problem or represents a real-world problem    the recognition that many visibly different applied problems might be linked by the same mathematical description, and that what we learn from one system\/situation could teach us about another---even though we might not recognize any direct real-world similarities between the two systems      "

This relationship can be represented in a variety of ways:     with a table of values    with a graph    with an equation      Ex: A taxi out of Dulles Airport in Washington, DC, charges a traveler an initial fee of $2.00, plus $1.50 for each mile traveled.

What is the charge for a trip to Mount Vernon, 35 miles from the airport? Illustrate the answer on your graph.    If a ride to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) costs $42.50, how far is it from the airport to the NIH? Illustrate the answer on your graph.     The  of a graph are the points where the graph crosses the axes.     The  is the point found by setting  and solving for y.    The  is the point found by setting  and solving for x.      Ex: Find the intercepts of the graph in the airport example above. What do these intercepts represent?   Graphing a Line Using the “Intercept Method”:      Find the - and -intercepts.    Plot the intercepts.    Choose a value of and find a third point on the line to make it a bit easier to make the line straight.    Draw a line through the points.     In the airport example, the model was of the form  Models of this form are called  .  Linear equations can also be written in what is sometimes called general form:    Ex: Five pounds of body fat is equivalent to 16,000 calories. Carol can burn 600 calories per hour bicycling and 400 calories per hour swimming.     Write an equation in general form that relates the number of hours, , of cycling and the number of hours, , of swimming Carol needs to perform to burn 16,000 calories.    Find the intercepts and use them to sketch the graph of the linear equation.      What do the intercepts tell us about Carol's exercise program?    Is the graph you drew in part (2) increasing or decreasing ?      Ex: Frank plants a dozen corn seedlings, each 6 inches tall. With plenty of water and sunlight they will grow approximately 2 inches per day.     Complete the table of values for the height, , of the seedlings after days.                     0  5  10  15  20  25                       Write an equation for the height of the seedlings in terms of the number of days since they were planted.    Find the intercepts of the graph.    Graph the equation.    What do the intercepts tell us about the problem?     "

If it continues to grow at the same rate, how long will it take the population of Egypt to double?      Given your answer to the first part, use the doubling time to write the population’s growth law.        At its current rate of growth, the population of the U.S. will double in 115.87 years.

If you make payments per year for years into an annuity that pays interest rate compounded times per year, the  future value  , , of the annuity is where each payment is dollars.    If you wish to receive payments per year for years from a fund that earns interest rate compounded times per year, the  present value  , , of the annuity must be where each payment is dollars.
