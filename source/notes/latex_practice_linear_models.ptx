                Using mathematical theory, notation, methods, and tools to answer practical questions is a

                        the realization that the letter <m>x</m> in an equation might represent the physical size of a cell, the cost of a sweater, the size of a population, the age of a company, etc.

                        the understanding that although we are interested in a specific application problem, we have to carefully apply the rules of mathematics to achieve a solution – we solve an equation the same way whether or not it is purely a mathematical problem or represents a real-world problem

                A model describes a relationship between variables.
                This relationship can be represented in a variety of ways:
