            <p>
                Suppose we want to fit the exponential function <m>f(x) = ab^{x}</m> to two known data points.
                To do so, we can use the “ratio method”:

                            Plug the coordinates of each point into the exponential function to write two equations in terms of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.

                        <p>
                            Divide one equation by the other to eliminate <m>a</m> and solve for <m>b</m>.

                            Substitute <m>b</m> into either equation from Step 1 and solve for <m>a</m>.

Using the formula for present value of an annuity, how large will your monthly payment be to pay off the loan in 5 years?
