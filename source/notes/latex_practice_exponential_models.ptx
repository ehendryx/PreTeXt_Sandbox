    <title>Section 4.5: Exponential Models</title>

    <p>
        Suppose we want to fit the exponential function <m>f(x) = ab^{x}</m> to two known data points.
        To do so, we can use the “ratio method”:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Plug the coordinates of each point into the exponential function to write two equations in terms of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Divide one equation by the other to eliminate <m>a</m> and solve for <m>b</m>.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Substitute <m>b</m> into either equation from Step 1 and solve for <m>a</m>.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <alert>Ex:</alert> Find an exponential function that has the values <m>f(2) = 4.5</m> and <m>f(5)=121.5</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        <alert>Ex:</alert> Find a formula for the exponential function shown below.
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>
    +[domain=-6.2:6.2, mark=none, black, thick,&#x3C;->] (,(3/2)*(9)^(/10));+[mark=*,mark options =fill = black,black] table  -5 0.5 ; +[mark=*,mark options =fill = black,black] table  5 4.5 ;
    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
        <alert>Ex:</alert> In 2005, the population of Egypt was 74 million and was growing by 2%per year.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                If it continues to grow at the same rate, how long will it take the population of Egypt to double?
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Given your answer to the first part, use the doubling time to write the population’s growth law.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <alert>Ex:</alert> At its current rate of growth, the population of the U.S. will double in 115.87 years. What is the annual percent growth rate of the population?
    </p>

    <p>
        <alert>Ex:</alert> Alcohol is eliminated from the body at a rate of 15%per hour. What is the half-life of alcohol in the body?
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
        An <em> </em> is a sequence of equal payments or deposits made at equal time intervals.
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                If you make <m>n</m> payments per year for <m>t</m> years into an annuity that pays interest rate <m>r</m> compounded <m>n</m> times per year, the <alert> <em>future value</em> </alert>, <m>FV</m>, of the annuity is
                <me>
                    FV = \frac{P\left[\left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}- 1\right]}{\frac{r}{n}},
                </me>
                where each payment is <m>P</m> dollars.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                If you wish to receive <m>n</m> payments per year for <m>t</m> years from a fund that earns interest rate <m>r</m> compounded <m>n</m> times per year, the <alert> <em>present value</em> </alert>, <m>PV</m>, of the annuity must be
                <me>
                    PV = \frac{P\left[1 - \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{-nt}\right]}{\frac{r}{n}},
                </me>
                where each payment is <m>P</m> dollars.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <alert>Ex:</alert> You want to finance $25,000 to purchase a new car, and your financing institution charges an annual interest rate of 2.7%, compounded monthly. Using the formula for present value of an annuity, how large will your monthly payment be to pay off the loan in 5 years? In 6 years? <em>Note: Making a sequence of equal payments on a loan (plus interest) is called <alert>amortizing</alert> the loan.</em>
