  <p>
    Where have you seen math applied in other courses or even daily life?
  </p>

  <p>
    Using mathematical theory, notation, methods, and tools to answer practical questions is a
  </p>

  <p>
    form of <em> </em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    One important skill to succeed in this class and beyond is <alert>abstraction</alert>concepts!abstraction:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        the realization that the letter <m>x</m> in an equation might represent the physical size of a cell, the cost of a sweater, the size of a population, the age of a company, etc.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        the understanding that although we are interested in a specific application problem, we have to carefully apply the rules of mathematics to achieve a solution – we solve an equation the same way whether or not it is purely a mathematical problem or represents a real-world problem
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>
        the recognition that many visibly different applied problems might be linked by <em>the same</em> mathematical description, and that what we learn from one system/situation could teach us about another – even though we might not recognize any direct real-world similarities between the two systems
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
